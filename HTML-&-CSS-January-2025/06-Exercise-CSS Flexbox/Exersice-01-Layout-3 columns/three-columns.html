                    <p>
                        Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov,
                        who sought to create an ethical system for humans and
                        robots.

                    <p>
                        A robot may not injure a human being or, through
                        inaction, allow a human being to come to harm

                    <p>
                        A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings
                        except where such orders would conflict with the First
                        Law

                    <p>
                        A robot must protect its own existence as long as such
                        protection does not conflict with the First or Second
                        Law

                        Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or
                        zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated that

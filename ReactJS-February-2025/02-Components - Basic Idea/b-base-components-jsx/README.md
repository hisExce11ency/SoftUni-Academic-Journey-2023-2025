# React + Vite

This is a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

It is part of a lecture demo of Components: Basic Idea. In this lecture we have discused:

1. Components Overview - how it works under the hood.
2. Flow in React.
3. Components State.
4. Handling DOM Events.
5. Condisional Rendering.
